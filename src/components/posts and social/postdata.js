Non-essential shops, cinemas, hairdressers and gyms closed on Tuesday and schools were to follow on Wednesday. Citizens have been told to refrain from booking non-essential travel abroad until mid-March. Restrictions will be eased slightly for the three days of Christmas, when Dutch households are allowed three instead of two guests, not counting children under 13.Mr Rutte delivered his address as protesters could be heard whistling and shouting outside his office. \"We need to bite this very sour apple before things get better. And yes they will get better. There will come a time when coronavirus will be behind us, when our lives will be normal again,\" he said.\"It won't be now, or in a week, or a month. But with the vaccine, 2021 will indeed be a year of hope and of light at the end of the tunnel.\"The announcement comes amid concern at the surge in infections in the country, recently seeing some 10,000 infections recorded in a single day.Over the weekend a number of Dutch cities asked people to stay away as photos showed stores packed with Christmas shoppers"

        text: `Non-essential shops will close across the country from Wednesday, as will schools, with children to be cared for at home wherever possible.

        Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed Christmas shopping for a "considerable" rise in social contacts.
        
        The latest figures showed 20,200 more infections and a further 321 deaths.
        
        The new lockdown will run from 16 December to 10 January. Announcing the move after meeting leaders of the country's 16 states, Mrs Merkel said there was "an urgent need to take action".
        
        A maximum of five people from no more than two households are allowed to gather in a home. But this will be relaxed from 24 to 26 December when one household will be able to invite a maximum of four close family members from other households.Restaurants, bars and leisure centres have already been closed since November, and some areas of the country had imposed their own lockdowns.

        Under the national lockdown, essential shops, such as those selling food, will stay open, as can banks. Outlets selling Christmas trees can also continue trading. Hair salons are among the businesses which must close.
        
        Companies are being urged to allow employees to work from home`

        text: `Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

        Congressional leaders announced agreement on a bill — which would send new federal assistance to households, small businesses and health-care providers for the first time in months and provide $1.4 trillion to fund the government through Sept. 30 — after days of start-and-stop efforts to finish a deal. They released text of the legislation Monday afternoon and aim to pass it before midnight.
        At long last, we have the bipartisan breakthrough the country has needed,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor Sunday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the plan a “package that delivers urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates.” They called the plan inadequate and noted they would soon push for more relief spending after President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.`
